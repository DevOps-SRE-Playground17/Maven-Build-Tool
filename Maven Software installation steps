Maven Installation
===================
System Requirements 
--------------------
--> Maven 3.9+ requires JDK 8 or above to execute.
--> No memory minimum requirement
--> Disk [Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself.]
--> Operating System [No minimum requirement. Start-up scripts are included as shell scripts (tested on many Unix flavors) and Windows batch files.]
=========================================================================================================================================

NOTE: All the external software is stored in the /opt directory

Step 0: Launch an EC2 machine & connect to that machine

Step 1: sudo su -  [switch to root user first]

step 2: Install java
-------------------
yum update -y = To update packages/system

javac -version = To know/search the version of Java

NOTE: If you want to search in a Linux server, use the command below

sudo yum search java | grep -i OpenJDK   = To find Java versions, and also it will show wherever openjdk matches, it will display all versions

javac -version = To know/search the version of Java

java 21
--------
sudo yum install java-21-openjdk-devel -y  = Install java 21 version

Step 3: Install Maven software
------
Pre-Requisite Software
-----------------------------
Java (JDK) is the prerequisite software for Maven.

1) Log in as a root user and change the directory to /opt/

sudo su - already I'm in root only

cd /opt/  = change directory to OPT because all external software is downloaded in /opt/


2) Download the Maven Software
===============================
yum install wget unzip -y  = Before installing Maven software, try to install wget and unzip commands

Go to browser ----- search --- mavendownload ---- click on official website --- select 2nd option ----- Binary zip code or bimar tar archive, don't need source code ---
right-click on the link ----- copy link address---- and paste it in notepad.

Wget is a command used in Linux to download files from the internet to your computer

Wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.11/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.zip  - maven not installed, just downloaded in zip format, we need to unzip and install

unzip apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.zip  ---- to unzip the zip file

3) Set the class path/Environmental Variable

# User-specific environment and startup programs


vi ~/.bash_profile  ---> add below two statements

Click the insert mode and then write the code below and esc, :wq

export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.11
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

mvn -version or mvn -v ----> Not installed , you need to load 

source ~/.bash_profile

mvn -version or mvn -v
